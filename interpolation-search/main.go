/*
The Interpolation Search is an improvement over Binary Search for instances, where the values in a sorted array are uniformly distributed.
 Binary Search always goes to middle element to check. On the other hand interpolation search may go to different locations according the v
 alue of key being searched. Here is the source code of the Go program to search element in an integer array using Interpolation search algorithm.
 The output shows the position of element in array.
